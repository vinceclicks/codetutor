CodeTutor was my first foray into building a React project on my own. My primary focus was on practicing ES6 and React, so the design was kept simple. The goal was to create a webpage where programming tutors could be paired with students.

-This project uses React, Reactstrap, React Router, Random User Generator API, and Node Package Manager.

-Code tutor information was fetched from a random user API. I then combined two sets of data to add rating information and skills to each tutor. The data set was mapped onto cards and various filtering and sorting options were created to help students find the most applicable tutor.

-Login and Signup forms were created, and React Router was used to move between pages on the application.

-Nearly all the styling was done with the Reactstrap framework. In future projects I intend on incorporating design more thoroughly, but this project made for great practice in getting comfortable with React.
